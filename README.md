# Deep learning

- This is the notebook that I shared during the meetup. The notebook is inspired by [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) Deep Learning Part 1: Practical Deep Learning for Coders.

- The original fast.ai libraries and also the lesson notebooks can be found in this [Github Repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastai).

- Based on my experience, running locally without GPU(CPU only mode) is excruciatingly slow and sometimes just freezes. I would highly recommended you to spin up a cloud instance with GPU and follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). I am using google cloud and instructions to setup the instance and fastai libraries can be found [here](https://medium.com/@howkhang/ultimate-guide-to-setting-up-a-google-cloud-machine-for-fast-ai-version-2-f374208be43).

That's all for now. 
## Have fun deep learning
